# Mini Compiler (CC)

This project focuses on the **design and implementation of compiler phases**, including lexical analysis, parsing, and symbol table management.  
It demonstrates how source code is converted into tokens, parsed, and checked for syntax and symbol consistency.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- C++ (Core logic)
- Compiler Design concepts
- Visual Studio Code (IDE)

---

## 🚀 Usage
> This project focuses on the design and implementation of compiler phases.  
> Compilation and execution depend on system configuration (MinGW/GCC).

If GCC or MinGW is properly configured, the project can be compiled as:
```
g++ src/*.cpp -o compiler
./compiler
```

## 🧠 Features
- Lexical Analysis (Token generation)
- Syntax Parsing
- Symbol Table Construction
- Error Detection (Basic)

---

## 📜 Note
This project is prepared for **semester submission** in *Compiler Construction (CC)*.  
The focus is on understanding compiler design concepts rather than execution environment setup.  
Code compilation may vary depending on local configurations.
